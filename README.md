## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/studyhaxer/inventory-management-system.git
cd inventory-management-system
```

### Backend Setup

Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate virtual environment

**Windows**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/app/` (this is the path used by `docker-compose.yml` and `.gitignore`).
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/inventory_db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

### Run the Backend

**Locally**, from `backend/`:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --app-dir app --reload
```

**With Docker** (also starts PostgreSQL and the frontend), from the project root:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
